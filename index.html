	<h2>About Nick Coombs!</h2>

	<p>My name Is Nick Combs from Derry New Hampshire. I was born December 10th 1997. I live with both of my parents as well as my older brother Ryan.</p>
	<p> Age 21. I have a golden retriever named Callie. First year at college I went to Wingate University in North carolina to chase my dreams of Playign D1 Lacrossse. Only reason I came closer to home is to be closer to my true friends and my family and plan on tranferring out and going to Umass Lowell or Endicott to continue playing Lacrosse.!</p>
